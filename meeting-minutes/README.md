# CEG7370-Spring2024-Project
This folder can contain all meeting-minutes documents throughout the project.

## Date: 3/20/2024

## Attending
* Calvin, Antrea

## Regrets


### Agenda
* Brainstorming Phase II next steps.
* Did we find any method from our literature review that can expand into video processing ?
* The parallel application could be taking multiple videos and analyzing them frame by frame ? 
* Look into "Parallel image segmentation using multi-threading and k-means algorithm" paper, we could add on that methodology maybe ?
* Possible datasets : [Traffic Light] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/highway-traffic-videos-dataset)

### Action
* TODO
    * Individually work on developing some python code regarding the dataset and compare results.
    * Calvin will try to implement parallel processing while using a senson in the frames.
    * Antrea will try to divide the videos, counting car individually in each part and then adding        them together.
    

### Additional Notes
* Sequentially getting the frames of the videos and counting cars.
* Try using cv2 library from python.
* We will be adding on the specific field ( parallel image processing) rather than a specific method since in most of our papers we used for literature review state video applications as their next steps.
